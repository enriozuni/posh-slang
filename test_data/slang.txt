i would never have sex with some body i don't love.
if you want to make someone love you then simply telling them that you like them won't do shi!t.
and, why is it the best?
too late if he fell for the person u set him up
i don't want this new guy to be a rebound guy, b/c i really like him.
thats about all i will post here,sorry
kiss her like its all you ever want to do because your love for her runs so deep.
Do things that make you happy and feel good inside.
Ask him if he wants to get coffee or something.
he will wonder what else is out there .
Baby, you're my one and only, etc.).
You should feel ashamed and dirty!
some ppl say im sexy and others just say im hott.
or other wise GET OVER IT!!
yelling, screaming, name game, blaming is nothing when it comes to emotional abuse.
Its fun, it feels good, why stop something you're having too much fun doing???
totally depends on the girls whether you deserve a 2nd chance.
U will know very soon how interesting these married men r!
if you are in a relationship with him then seem sad or something and he asks whats that matter?
don't break up another couple so you can have a girl.
It is for my daughter if I ever have one!
For some guys, kids not their own is a bad thing, others don't mind.
oh my goodness this is so happening to me, right now.
LOOK just come out with IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU DON'T GET
only you and eric know that.
YOU NEED TO TURN NOW TO ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE AND SEEK PROFESSIONAL COUNSELING NOW.
if you've got the money, hell yeah, get it over with and good for you.
Why don't U just get out of the house and meet someone.
If he loved you he wouldn't play a joke on you like that.
my friend tommi she loves her b/f.
write me and i'll email a photo.
live, love and be happy...and yea, have more kids (,)
let him/her get fed-up of annoying you while you just think as if nothing exist.
I think you ruined a good thing.
now i dont know if that is true or not.
where does the passion go after marriage?
Like you're going to get it!
Flirting with other women is not one of them.
but if that fails annoy them to the point that they dont want to annoy you anymore
Perhaps YOU could call and ask him what's up?
you could of told me in person... jeez!
Hey isn’t that what we all want a friend that we are in love with.
go 4 it your in love and u wanna b with this person forever
Well if I was u I would had said F***K You and go ahead with my buniness.
(that goes for men and women)
Girl this is something that I want you to remember...  Guys would LIE no matter what you do... Why?
if you want my help we need to speak privately because it's just too dangerous.
woul'd that make the shallow coat like shield go away?
yes SEX is very important in marrage
If not she is just a girlfriend.
it's a chemical reaction :) and sometimes more than that...
Im pretty sure they do if its not an absurd amount (5?)
beacuse they are afraid that they mayn't fullfill their commitment since they have so many burden i.e family,office,girlfriend,friends etc.
Just be careful though cos the other person might take it the wrong way and leave!
one unless you are a jack-ass
In my experience, NO...I wasted two more years of my life trying to stay married.
i can't say i have done it before but know people who did.
u have to touch it really gently.
u could do it in the shower.
just tell him that you really like him ... as a friend.
say hey,_______ i was just wondering what u think of me.
i say DON`T GO FOR HIM!
she hated giving head, she said it hurt her jaw.
Try a few different things & see what works for the two of you!
If you rush into it, it's just not as nice.
(don't forget to be romantic and suave!)
and it depends if theyre really goth (satan worshipping) or if theyre just posers and like the style.
Yes if it says and/or on the title!
Give him a chance because he is a different person.
As long as it's fully covered when u wear your hat you should be ok... ;)
wtf...i agree wit old man n just me...if he is only lookin lol... den dats not sexual abuse!
your kids are going to look great
take it from someone who has made that mistake already!!!!!!
i guess that it's my responsiblity once again.
no but i would with someone elses grandma!!
Oh well, atleast they answered correctly!
body language is sayin or expressing ur felling thru ur body movemnt instead of using ur mouth.
as long as you've got a good personality your alright.
but it all happen when he/she confused whethr he loves u or not.
if its love whats to think about?
me i have 6 dogs i play for the lackland lightnings
she did to me what we are going to do to your fella.
because that is how life is.
Or, if you can't do that, return the gifts and do not accept any more.
Worry less about her, and more about you.
so please help me out idont know whattod
I guess if you die....it was too much.
You might be a 'full steam ahead!'
but if he says no fast without thinking that means he just wants to be friends
you need to go over and talk to them
Tell her or send her roses¡¡¡
the problem is i dont want to lost all of them!
Men cheat because women lie and make altimatums.
so u start sendin mixed messages too!
if you're not with her, then don't worry- chances are you think it's love but it's not.
So I started beating her @$$!
dont u think he will want somebody else when u will become his gf?
Think about that and you will realize you made the right choice.
that's the best thing to do.
No, this is not true for everyone!!
sometimes there are happy ending and then again not.
love is the best feeling yet sucks if it wasn't meant for you!
you cant get over someone that you still spend time with.
don't think about it, just do it!
CHECK FROM WHERE HE CALL LAST TIME
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE IS TO BE TOLD BY THE PERSON THEMSELVES.
when i asked her if this was good, she told me that she thinks so.
YOu should be asking your self what kind of person are you.
Have breakfast of her when you wake up.
ya,, he would walk out with toilet paper, doughnuts, everything but what he was sent in there for!
nope...i would look for the cure first
yes anyone who says otherwise is just trying not to hurt someone's feelings
and u must know her sensitive points of her body.
use your pretty little mouth, that is the only time my ex would ever really give me a bj.
Its gross like some little girls thing.
I wouldn't have married him right away, though.
the guhs at my school love the blonde preppy bleh.
marrige dont go by age as number you should know what marrige should be and why.
i dont know did he i think that would be very disappointing
you giving her something shows that you were thinking about her which is good.
the girl is a selfish brat lose her and find someone nice.
i guess it would have to be he would be more understanding.
ya that would be a big NEGATIVE!
same reason people don't like being held accountable for there own actions!
you need to read the questions that have already been answered here to get an idea what to do
lol  Good for you for sticking to your guns!
If you are just friends then you will not worry about them becoming involved with someone else.
Never, ever, ever sh1t where you eat...
He says he wants to be with me, but why isn't he acting like it at all?
a girl made me this way.
well, tell em, Let em know.
you should talk to her about it
I think at the end it's not importand how many boyfriends u made to add to ur list.
if yo u are in love it WILL be good.sex is bonus of love and marriage.
take it easy and everything will fall in to place.
I am currently going out w/ some1 that is y i ask
and you can trust your partner!
think of all the bad qualitys of him and imagine him being bad too you
no you should set him strait and continue
we should do the cheating thingy!
its hard sometimes being apart and seeing ur own!
if you really like the guy then do not break up just because other girls are jealous.
Don't go acting like all girls are like that: everyone has different personality.
but it doesnt seem like you redally need that.
I really liked him and knew the relationship would be over if I said no.
The 5 love languages, Chapman Smart Love, Phil McGraw  after that it should be self explanitory.
People always talk about lovers being great friends and what not.
Don't give your phone number and just say it was fun.
but the only person i was the be with is my boyfriend and we have what we call trust.
how they cross they legs, how they stand and walk.
Disgusted with you, but hope you get your life on track!
if u are sure about that it is so easy.
before going out and just doing things like before.
I really liked this guy too.
yes i want to chat any ladies
If u don't know weather u r or not,then u r not.
Some guys want girl to talk dirty to them.
not really, unless its way too big, then ouch!
Same reasons why men do the same.r not serious.
I have w/ my granda, grandma don't smoke
but dont hang out with the wrong crowd.
i think that everything foreign is interesting to me...
but honestly u could give it all you've got.
these are not so close boy and girl friends and meet only in college premises.
You can't force her to like you.
if you ever decide to leave him it will probably nearly like him.
i really want to help you.
Ladies think it is cute... Just DON'T do it in front of their co-workers or friends.
well its the opposite of good lol
no but i think i found a young, shallow, closed minded girl.
or the man being a little to sad down there.?
you should take charge- ask him yourself
how do you know his feelings arent mutual!!!!!!!!
Look at it this way...you are gaining a son!!!
: )  We're not boring...trust me.
Obviously, you don't want to blow up on her.
yes, especially if you know you love them.
try to b frns with her 1st lor...
I CERTAINLY AGREE with jdd3636 on his answer!!
hallo,r u mad u have 2 choose one ,n that,s if u know what love mean,s.
if you use sex to find love all you have is a fling.
if both of u are cheating you shouldnt be together--u guys are looking for different things out there.
of course u won't fall on first sight.
It's like saying, Look at my butt-floss!
i've been everywhere and i have meet alot of girls.
Girl you need to drop him... because he sounds like a trick.
Marriage is not something that you just do because you feel like it...
one of they is kinda iffy.
No one likes to hang out with rude people.
if it clicks and you two really want to do it, then why not.
if it's mutual, all the better!
how do ask a girl to be my girlfriend?
What about finding a cute chubby girl?
my ex's double ex does that, and she never flurts with him
if you sure about this information just get divorced
And by the way u know it better whether you like the guy or not.
you are little weird dude...you ask all this strange questions about 'family'
and she helped me throw a party.
What ever you do, don't set him up to fail, accept him for the great things he does do
theres still rooms you haven't open yet.
when he breaks up with the other girl you can have him .
okay this is good one... Start with sharing fantasies.
If you're trying to be subtle, then I recomend that you make it a 'no big deal' thing.
go out what could be worse
because he doesnt want anymore conversation... WHY?
say ur sorry and hope he wont have been to humiliated
Depends on when he had the baby.
not all guys are the same.
then you say im so stressed, can i kiss you?
I don't think so (father of three)
the love to see them grow and know u as person!
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TALK TO HER.
that's like asking why are men assholes.
The bills, the kids, the jobs, blah, blah, etc.
hmm... touch question... Why dont you send me a pic a lemme decide whether you are or not??
before u ask next time type ur question in search.....this question is asked more than a 1000 times...
so maybe you shouldn't feel so bad at least until you talk to him.
Just leave your email loged on accidentally...and see what happens!
dont come back onto him too quickly, just make sure he knoes ur glad to be back with him.
do u think i'm boyfriend material.
has your guy asked your dad yet?
sort of person, and you could be just as right with that approach as any other.
You just have to have enough balls!
love is life  love, and life would love back you  so love all
Gotta go where the type of man you desire is.
#2 - You're in 8th grade?
hi im 15 and i live in USA-TX how r u
IT CAN BE DONE, BUT IT'S HARD TO TRUST A CHEATTNG INDEVIDUAL,YOU MIGHT FORGIVE BUT YOU NEVER FORGET.
but i know they mostly arent all gay.
no human knows love, only god
and if he think about it.
IF THE CAT IS OUT THE BAG LET HIM MAKE A MOVE.
Not sure but i guess it could mean a three-way: female-guy-female
No glove , no love... he got the point!
Dear what makes u think that married men r boring.
i know my guy like me to lick his nipples and penis.
I don't want to go to the bar and hook up with some guy.
Skinny girls ycuk,  you get that skinny girl taste in your mouth.
Not really........remember what they say .......the fruits of patience are always rewarding!
I THINK U ARE JUST A SEXY BEAST
It's already been said but I'm going to say it again... No glove, no love.
not any more than other people.
i am so sorry i wish i could help.
you say he's giving her what you couldn't .
because you have some hot buns!
If your little sisters like my sister then she is a guy crazy middle-schooler!
if he does say thanks and u see he's a nice one, then u got yourself a boyfriend.
If u r enjoying his love then continue untill u not caught some fresh fish like meeeeeeee.
Plus, you have to know that your daddy is just that, your daddy.
Its getting really out of hand, its affecting my schoolwork, but it won't go away
If you really love this lucky lady.... KEEP IT REAL WITH YOURSELF!
MAYBE HE HAS SOMEONE AND IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
because your as rare as the blue bearded tit mouse.
But I love her to much to hurt her.
Girls meet different kinds of guys - good/bad, handsome/ugly, etc.
Don't worry...He'll get his chance to be happy with you, too, someday.
First u have to no ur gf like what type of guy.
He's a jerk, U need to drop him like he's hot.
If u give love u'll receive love.
Nah...ask him out...for coffee or lunch or something and talk to him.
Hey, just keep your options open.
There is a girl i like.
If its just on friendship level then No!
well see if your with the right person.
there are tons of fish in the sea though.
my life is over if that is true!!
especially if they become involved with someone?
Say you reserved a table for 2 then go to star bucks or whatever its called
i'd sign up there and browse for people in your area
i AGREE WITH U,PEOPLE LACK COMMITTMENT.
If you ugly, women won't give you any lovin'...
online dating with pictures..you get a backround and you know what they look like
But from what I've heard is that girls like someone funny, caring & honest.
who cares.... all she will be known for is giving he*d to Clinton.
ONE girl at a time is the best bet...
go back to him say sorry-offer to buy him 2 coffies
Just be a man about it and don't ever kiss and tell.
so please i really need some advise on what to do!!!
if you think you are becoming a hoe then you are guilty of being one...
ya..I am 200 yrs old..will this okie for you..lol
well probably if your pretty cool yes well it depends what kind a guy is he
What it means is be careful who your friends are!
So you could fathe rhis children :)
I myself am a devout Christian, I do not have premarrital sex or even kiss.
cause im a boy, believe me, we like something nice, espiacally on first dates and stuff like that.
Sure, if you are a Christian!
for me the hoter are the good ones because they has an altitude that a girl likes.
your bf is stupid tell him ur bi but that u would never do anyting sense ur with him
If he said maybe... it's not worth it!!
the middle finger: for use when annoyed b.)
as long as she loves the woman...love can wait even if it takes forever....
the Asian culture is rich in...what the hell, look at it this way....a billion chinese people can't be wrong....
I just have bad luck when it comes to dating.
If you don't want to have kids...stay single!
Even WITH all that, i have a hard time trusting ANYTHING she says.
how cac I find out my husbands voice mail code?
suppose it depends!.....it could be either she cant get rid of you or she likes being stuck with you!lol
THERE ISN'T A THING LIKE LESSER OR GREATER LOVE.
Because if no sex is involved then it's not illegal, no matter what the age.
forget and walk away he someone elses there are plenty unmarried fish in the sea
youll see what you need and dont need and it makes it very easy!
SURE U CAN E-MAIL ME AT: martha95355@yahoo.com  I can use some male advice too.
forget the other guys for now.
And with the truck, he could pull her horse trailer!
he is too young to think straight.
And how would you marry her?, if your a girl?, but if you do, she'll cheat on you too...
The liberals do it everyday, why can't you too!
If it's CRAP, then FLUSH it.
well why did you break up with them?
it depends... if u r losing it..u will b hurt.. (life is a love...love it)
buy her a bracelette or something you know she has been needing or wanting.
I gave freedom to the person I love and, she didn't have to ask for it!
Why did the two of split?
or is it that she still gives you favors that you don't want to let go of?
we are always fighting and he never helps out with the baby or the house.
ok here is a link where u can find some single chats.....good luck!
would say a long skirt or a nice pants outfit.
you are my pawn and i'll move you how and when i feel like it.
After we're married, and no I wouldn't consider having sex with anyone else.
im really nice i have blond and brown hair i love dogs and soccer and i want a bf
sex is great but tru love is out there.
i like chris brown but he is to young for me
I DONT THINK SO BUT IM 15 MYSELF
not your average joe is attractive to gay guys.
If they do not accept that they are just friends then I break up with them.
dear, there's no such thing as 'love' at first sight.
Because she had a blonde boyfriend!!!
run and tell all your friends to run.
you don't, you can't, you move on and learn from your mistake.. and not make it again
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
!..do what you r doing now,acting lyk an innocent..sorry missus,flirting is nature,its ugly wen nurtured
i still love my husband, but only the good not the bad.
I am a well endowed male and would not have it any other way, because women just dig it!
I agree with Rock Nate ... follow your heart - if you truly love him, you will wait!
yur ryt bout chris brown nd bout yur frend yoo shud e mail each oder
what is up with these guys??
Honestly, at your age it might be tough...
Tell him you just wanted to bone.
TRY TO HAVE A FIREND ALONG TO PROTECT YOUR FLIRTY ASSS
I say yes  now are you still looking for someone special to marry ?
that has always worked for me
God, I know what you mean.
one man one woman one marriage.sex is not related to love do not make that mistake.
but do not fight or lie about it.
pick the one you like best and think which one will not dump you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I mean, people who just look at that kind of stuff are stupid anyway.
dont limit yourself to just one.
No man wants a wife who won't cook.
If you have such great sex why would you not want that again?

u consider yourself blind in things happening.
first of all you can't make a girl like you.
it is shorthand for a threesome...female guy female...lots of fun too
Personally I dont like it all bald.
be patient we grow out of it and mature.
so you've gotta decide right here and now.
A combination of it.Girls luv a person w/ good heart n at the same tym w/ good looks..........
I have no idea on what to get her!
If he's THAT bad, and counseling isn't an option ... just TELL him!!
so i wish u the best of luck in ur life and ur other half
put some anger behind your voice.
It is OK as long as she isn't a dude!
Sounds like you've got a good chance.
Columbus did and he only sank 1 ship, right?
smile you have a lot to look forward to in life
do you want to sleep with him?
Or maybe some post-partum depression or worried about getting pregnant so soon after just having a baby.
Tell her U WANNA GO OUT WITH ME???
I spent 5,000 on my dress!
The one who makes you feel special, of course!!
wht can u do about it.
u could but wait and think about it
HOW MANY TIMES WILL THIS BE ASKED?!?!?!
yes it is importent in a relationship
first of all, think about the way you act with him.
or a guy who paints his nails and drives a lexus?
Are you being nice to her?
Dude that is what I call LUST...
for religious resons.... there are so many people that are not as strong as you are.
now i've never had this type of connection with another person like that.
look it up in the dictionary!
I don't know if you mean will I ever have an affair or will I ever get over it?
Just to find what my girl friend thinks about me
Boys do it all the time, why not the other way around?
She is going to get jealous of your mom?
simply you go to Usa so that u can get a Wife from USA
LOVE IS AN WARM FEELING INSIDE OF YOU!!!
it will effect on ur next sex session.
If I where you, I wouldn't play his little games.
Be yourself, DON'T ask her how her day was....what if it stunk?
From what im guessing, you just want to talk to a girl?
And I am not donating it!
don't try to make him into something he's already not.
Watch the movie The Wedding Crashers and learn :)
start with.....what if I asked xxx to join us in bed?
Of course  the man that makes me special!
you cant feel it at the moment.
He was jealous, needy, he would get mad if I talked to anyone.
just chill with ur true friends and go shopping.
i startet to become jelous of this guy that she started to be with alot at work.
Can u tell me what would be ur dream girlfriend and her personality.
Should I just dump this girl?
I don't know why she would be so jealous of YOUR SISTER.
well, i dont know about other guys, but its kinda nice to have a lady approach me,
no way flaunt what uve got girl rub it in the other girls faces.
does she love him or even like him for any reason?
ok, i dun care if i sound rude, u need to get this in ur brain.
He gave His life, what more could He give?
I can tell you right now he is an ass hole!
; ) And NO I will NOT share her.
Because you will just have problems.
Children play that game...not the both of you.
You don't know what type of person, but if you keep your personal info.
well if i like the guy and it a romntice night any time
y would ur bro get mad atchu ?
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
i've clambaked my bathroom w/ my grandma.
wait if you guys are meant to end up together it'll happen
Do yourself a favor and WAIT!
the key thing on a man's mind .
You love your daughter so give her your blessings!!!
Go when u dont have classes,
Guys are just alot shyer these days.
or maybe they like the style.
no matter what ur actual age is, admit what you have done is immature.
16,i wish i would have waiting.
1st of all,dont kiss her if she has had a bad day.
Most young guys I know like dating older women.
C'mon ladies- does penis size really matter?
just relax and be nice (duh)
hmmm yea its true.if u dont mind......wanna kiss u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i want to say that you are a one of a kind.
i'm sorry, i'm only into lazy lovers and you don't qualify!
i just resently lost my virgnity and i am 17 i waited that long to have sex.
when you find free time win some money then buy the books but dont miss out on your classes.
i dunt understand ur question man
just say  i just want to now!Do u like me as a friend or something more?
she'll find out in the long run just like i did.
i couldnt sleep and she said she loves me but shes so confused and she started to cry.
HMMMMMMMMM I THINK YOU MIGHT BE GAY.
even though you know that you need to.
That would probably make it all ok.
i think reaky yes, maybe  he was busy, take it easy.
if she's got bail money, she fine by me.
DO NOT tell her anything negative about your wife, EVER.
how do i get her to forgive me for this misdeed done?
when you regret doing it after ur done.
b. listen to your heart :p c. listen to your hormones.
Just see her in person and tell herlook!
is he alot older than you?
of corse it depends on what relation u r looking for .
Wear a sign that says Hi!
I don't believe in playing games, I hate when guys do that to me.
(or w/e)   p.s gurl how old r u ?
Try to watch her to see what kind of things she likes to do, watch, talk about, eat, etc.
